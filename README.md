Some Closure Practice Problems For My Buddy Who Is Learning JS

# Instructions
Make Sure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you download Node then you will get [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) by default which you will need.

Clone down the repository.

Run `npm install` in the root directory of this project

To test your solutions run `npm test`. This will run [jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) in watch mode. This allows you to not have to type `npm test` over and over again as jest will watch for any changes that you make.

Good Luck!
